<p>Hey There! I am Ivo Cavelti.</p>
<p>Currently, I am doing my service in the Swiss military.<br>After that, I am planning to do a Bachelor in Computer Science at the University of Applied Sciences "OST" in Rapperswil.</p>
<p>I did an apprenticeship in application development at <a href="https://ergon.ch/">Ergon Informatik AG - ZÃ¼rich</a>. Mainly, I work with Java / Spring, Angular or ReactJS. But I am always on the lookout for new interesting technologies.</p>
<p>Most of my projects can be found on <a href="https://github.com/SirSoySauce">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Have a nice day!</p>
