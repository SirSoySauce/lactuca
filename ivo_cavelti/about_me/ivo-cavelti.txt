<p>Hey There! I am Ivo Cavelti.</p>
<p>Currently, I am doing my part-time bachelor in Computer Science at the University of Applied Sciences "OST" in Rapperswil. The days of the week when I'm not studying next to Lake Zurich, I work for the Swiss telecom company <a href="https://www.swisscom.ch/">Swisscom</a>.</p>
Mainly, I work with Java / Spring, Python or Angular / ReactJS. But I am always on the lookout for new interesting technologies.</p>
<p>Most of my projects can be found on <a href="https://github.com/SirSoySauce">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p><a href="contact_me.html">Here</a> you can find out how to reach me!</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>
